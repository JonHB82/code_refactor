# code_refactor

## Background

The code provided was not labeled in an effective and user-friendly manner. In addition, the style was not in order and had a number of duplicate lines.

## Body

All labels within the Body were Div. This has been changed to better reflect the content. 

* Header

The label was the only change made. Note: The "Horiseon" logo has multiple colors. This can be corrected if this is a deficiency. 

* Hero

The Hero image has been labeled as Figure. 

* Content and Benefits

These sections of the body have been relabeled as "main" with "article" as the subsections. 
Line 29 was missing an ID. This has been corrected. 

* Footer

The footer was labeled with h2. This has been changed to h4 for continuity. 

## Style

"Content" was written after "Benefits" in CSS. "Content" has been moved between the figure and "Benefits."

* Content

The formatting of the articles all match so they have been combined to eliminate duplicate code. This has been done for the images as well. 

* Benefits

The same issue in Content existed in Benefits. These have also been corrected. 

* Footer

The footer has been relabeled as h4 for continuity.
